React - A fast, compact UI-Based system

Think of react as a smart home, with components like a living room, kitchen, door, windows, etc. Each component is built seperately, then 
combined to build one home (web app). Each component manages its own state (eg living room lights being on/off) and each component can
simply re-render itself, without affecting other componenets.


Redux

Now if the smart home becomes more complex. We want a central panel to control all lights, all doors to be locked when the alarm is triggered,
or a thermostat to control every room's temperature. Instead of each component being independent, we introduce a control room that knows
everything, which is Redux.

Redux stores all global states in one place (control room). Send instructions (called actions) to update the state, and notifies relevant
parts of the house (React components) when changes are made.


React handles what you see (UI)
Redux handles what you do and remember (data/state)
